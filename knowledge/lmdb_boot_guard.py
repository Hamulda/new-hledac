"""
Sprint 8AG §1.4: Safe LMDB boot guard with strict stale-lock detection.

Provides fail-soft, idempotent LMDB open with process-liveness-verified lock cleanup.
Used BEFORE the first relevant LMDB open in any owner path.

DESIGN
------
- Strict stale-lock check: lock is reset ONLY when the holder is confirmed dead
- psutil / os.kill(pid, 0) for liveness verification
- Fail-safe = do NOT delete if holder cannot be reliably determined
- Idempotent: multiple calls produce the same result
- No blind deletion of native lock files

USAGE
