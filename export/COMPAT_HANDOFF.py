"""
Canonical producer-side handoff truth (Sprint 8VZ):

  PRIMARY PATH (canonical post-8VZ): __main__._print_scorecard_report() builds
    ExportHandoff(...) directly, sourcing top_nodes from store.get_top_seed_nodes().
    This is the canonical producer construction point — no dict intermediary.

  COMPAT SEAM (post-8VZ): from_windup(scorecard) is kept only for legacy
    call-sites that pass raw scorecard dicts. It is NO LONGER the canonical
    path in __main__.py.

  SCORECARD ROLE (post-8VZ): scorecard_data dict is retained for:
    - DuckDB persistence (upsert_scorecard)
    - Markdown export (_export_markdown_report)
    - JSON report serialization (export_sprint → eh.scorecard)
    It is NOT the canonical source for top_nodes in the export handoff.

  FUTURE TARGET (post-full-cutover): windup_engine returns typed ExportHandoff
    directly; from_windup(scorecard) disappears entirely;
    ensure_export_handoff() shrinks to None-only path.

  REMOVAL CONDITIONS (updated post-8VZ):
    1. ensure_export_handoff() for dict → SHORTER: only for non-main call-sites
    2. ensure_export_handoff() for None → removal when all callers pass typed ExportHandoff
    3. from_windup(scorecard) → REMOVED from __main__ canonical path (8VZ)
    4. scorecard["top_graph_nodes"] as top_nodes source → REMOVED from canonical path (8VZ)
    5. store.get_top_seed_nodes() fallback → removal when windup always populates top_nodes

  WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT:
    - NOT a new DTO system — ExportHandoff (types.py) is the only typed handoff
    - NOT an export framework — export plane is sprint_exporter.py
    - NOT a producer factory — __main__ constructs via direct ExportHandoff(), not via this module
    - NOT growing — new features go to windup_engine or types.py, not here

    Normalize ExportHandoff | dict | None → ExportHandoff.

    Three dispatch cases:
      1. ExportHandoff instance → returned unchanged (PRIMARY canonical path)
      2. dict (scorecard) → via from_windup(scorecard) — COMPAT SEAM A
      3. None → empty ExportHandoff — COMPAT SEAM B

    Compat seam A (dict path):
      from_windup() extracts scorecard["top_graph_nodes"] → top_nodes.
      Two chained compat seams: windup dict → scorecard dict → ExportHandoff.
      REMOVAL CONDITION: windup_engine returns typed ExportHandoff directly.

    Compat seam B (None path):
      Returns empty ExportHandoff with default_sprint_id.
      REMOVAL CONDITION: __main__ always passes typed ExportHandoff, never None.

    Args:
        handoff: ExportHandoff instance, dict (scorecard-style), or None
        default_sprint_id: fallback sprint_id if handoff is None

    Returns:
        ExportHandoff — always typed, never None

    NOTE: Thin compat adapter only. Does NOT create typed objects from raw facts.
          New features go to windup_engine or types.py ExportHandoff.from_windup().
