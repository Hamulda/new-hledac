# ⚠️  DEPRECATED THIN ADAPTER — DO NOT EXTEND
# Sprint F186C: Header shrunk; module is a compat seam, not a factory.
"""
Thin adapter: normalize any handoff input to typed ExportHandoff at the
export_sprint() consumer boundary.

Canonical producer: __main__._print_scorecard_report() constructs
ExportHandoff(...) directly — this module is NOT the producer construction point.

Compat seams preserved for backward compat (NOT exercised by canonical producer):
  A. dict → via from_windup(scorecard) — for legacy callers passing scorecard dicts
  B. None → empty ExportHandoff — defensive boundary for missing handoff

ensure_export_handoff() is a consumer-side normalization seam, NOT a factory.
New features go to windup_engine or types.py, not here.

    Normalize ExportHandoff | dict | None → ExportHandoff.

    Three dispatch cases:
      1. ExportHandoff instance → returned unchanged (PRIMARY canonical path)
      2. dict (scorecard) → via from_windup(scorecard) — COMPAT SEAM A
      3. None → empty ExportHandoff — COMPAT SEAM B

    Compat seam A (dict path):
      from_windup() extracts scorecard["top_graph_nodes"] → top_nodes.
      Two chained compat seams: windup dict → scorecard dict → ExportHandoff.
      REMOVAL CONDITION: windup_engine returns typed ExportHandoff directly.
      ACTIVE CALLERS: only non-main legacy call-sites (NOT __main__ — __main__ uses direct ctor).

    Compat seam B (None path):
      Returns empty ExportHandoff with default_sprint_id.
      REMOVAL CONDITION: __main__ always passes typed ExportHandoff (never None);
      currently active as defensive seam in export_sprint() consumer boundary.

    Args:
        handoff: ExportHandoff instance, dict (scorecard-style), or None
        default_sprint_id: fallback sprint_id if handoff is None

    Returns:
        ExportHandoff — always typed, never None

    NOTE: Thin compat adapter only. Does NOT create typed objects from raw facts.
