# =============================================================================
# F6: Capability Truth Normalization Seam
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE: Explicitly separate capability truth layers that were previously
# conflated in CapabilityRegistry.is_available() and CapabilityStatus.available.
#
# Before F6:
#   - CapabilityStatus.available mixed registry_declared and runtime_loaded
#   - is_available() returned True if loaded OR available (no distinction)
#   - No way to ask "declared but not yet effective for tool contract"
#
# After F6:
#   Four explicit layers with clear semantics:
#
#   declared_by_tool_contract:
#     - What tool contracts (Tool.required_capabilities) declare they need
#     - Source: tool_registry.py Tool definitions
#     - Questions answered: "Does web_search declare reranking?"
#
#   registry_declared_available:
#     - What CapabilityRegistry.register() sets as available=True
#     - Source: create_default_registry() or explicit register() calls
#     - Questions answered: "Did we register reranking as available?"
#     - DOES NOT answer: "Is the module actually importable?"
#
#   runtime_loaded:
#     - What CapabilityRegistry.load() successfully loaded into _loaded set
#     - Source: actual async loader invocation
#     - Questions answered: "Did we successfully call the loader?"
#
#   effective_for_tool_contract:
#     - What is both declared AND registry_available AND runtime_loaded
#     - Questions answered: "Can web_search actually use reranking right now?"
#     - This is the SOUND answer for tool execution decisions
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEAM, NOT A FRAMEWORK:
#   - No new global manager
#   - No new heavy backend
#   - No broad runtime rewiring
#   - Only a descriptor/helper API for truthful capability introspection
#   - Lazy: only probes module existence when explicitly asked
#
# RATIONALE FOR FOUR LAYERS (not three):
#   - declared != available is important for scaffold vs ready distinction
#   - available != loaded is important for on-demand vs eager distinction
#   - loaded != effective is important for tool contract decisions
#   Example: RERANKING is declared_by_tool_contract and
#   registry_declared_available (module path registered), but
#   runtime_loaded=False until first use. This is normal scaffold state.

      - Acquire/load owner:        brain.model_manager.ModelManager (singleton)
      - Unload/cleanup owner:      ModelManager._release_current_async()
                                    + brain.model_lifecycle.unload_model() (7K SSOT)
      - Phase enforcer (THIS):      COARSE-GRAINED phase enforcement ONLY
      - Capability layer:            NOT a load owner — NEVER becomes model truth

    THIS FACADE IS NOT A LOAD OWNER — F6.5 LOCKED INVARIANTS:
      - Does NOT call ModelManager.load_model() directly
      - Does NOT hold model references
      - Does NOT create model engines
      - Does NOT manage MLX buffer initialization
      Violating any of the above CREATES A THIRD MODEL TRUTH — FORBIDDEN.

    F6.5 LAYER MAPPING — MUST NOT BE CONFLATED:
      Layer 1 (workflow-level, ModelManager.PHASE_MODEL_MAP):
        PLAN/DECIDE/SYNTHESIZE → hermes
        EMBED/DEDUP/ROUTING → modernbert
        NER/ENTITY → gliner
        Strings: PLAN, DECIDE, SYNTHESIZE, EMBED, DEDUP, ROUTING, NER, ENTITY
      Layer 2 (coarse-grained, THIS class):
        BRAIN → hermes loaded, others released
        TOOLS → hermes released, on-demand
        SYNTHESIS → hermes loaded, others released  ← NOTE: ≠ SYNTHESIZE
        CLEANUP → all released
        Strings: BRAIN, TOOLS, SYNTHESIS, CLEANUP
      Layer 3 (windup-local, windup_engine.SynthesisRunner):
        Own isolated model plane with Qwen/SmolLM

    F6.5 HARD INVARIANTS:
      - acquire ≠ phase enforcement
      - unload ≠ phase policy
      - Layer 1 phases NEVER directly passed to ModelLifecycleManager
      - Layer 2 phases NEVER directly passed to ModelManager.PHASE_MODEL_MAP
      - SYNTHESIZE (Layer 1) ≠ SYNTHESIS (Layer 2) — false equivalence
      - capability layer MUST NOT become third model truth

    DRIFT GUARD: Use brain.model_phase_facts.is_same_layer() to validate
    before comparing or mapping phase strings across layers.

    Future seam: This facade may delegate to ModelManager.with_phase()
    after seam extraction — eliminating the CapabilityRegistry round-trip.
