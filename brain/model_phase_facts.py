Sprint 8TF: Phase Drift Guard — Pure Facts Helper
================================================

Tiny pre-seam scaffold for reading phase/model facts without implicit
cross-layer confusion.

PURPOSE:
  - Provide an authoritative single place to look up phase-layer facts
  - Prevent implicit conflation of workflow-level ↔ coarse-grained phases
  - Help future scheduler/shadow code to read phase facts correctly

WHAT THIS IS:
  - Pure facts helper (no state, no side effects, no new subsystem)
  - Late-import accessor (imported only when needed)
  - Compatibility alias surface

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
  - NOT a new model subsystem
  - NOT a new orchestrating class
  - NOT a cross-plane model API layer
  - NOT a replacement for ModelManager or ModelLifecycleManager

PHASE LAYERS:

  Layer 1 — Workflow-level (ModelManager.PHASE_MODEL_MAP):
    PLAN      → hermes
    DECIDE    → hermes
    SYNTHESIZE → hermes
    EMBED     → modernbert
    DEDUP     → modernbert
    ROUTING   → modernbert
    NER       → gliner
    ENTITY    → gliner

  Layer 2 — Coarse-grained (ModelLifecycleManager.enforce_phase_models):
    BRAIN     → hermes loaded, others released
    TOOLS     → hermes released, others on-demand
    SYNTHESIS → hermes loaded, others released
    CLEANUP   → all released

  Layer 3 — Windup-local (windup_engine.SynthesisRunner):
    Qwen/SmolLM isolated from runtime-wide model plane

AUTHORITY:
  This file is a COMPATIBILITY AID — not a new authority.
  The canonical owners remain:
    - ModelManager (acquire/load)
    - ModelLifecycleManager (phase enforcement facade)
    - brain.model_lifecycle (unload cleanup)

USAGE:

      COARSE_GRAINED_PHASES,
      is_workflow_phase,
      is_coarse_grained_phase,
