"""
Sprint 8TF: Graph Store Attachment Guards — probe tests

Tests lock the following invariants:
1. Store does NOT call graph methods it doesn't have (no silent AttributeError)
2. DuckPGQGraph is correctly detected as non-bufferable (no false positives)
3. IOCGraph is correctly detected as bufferable (no false negatives)
4. Background ingest is gated by capability check (not silently skipped)
5. aclose teardown handles close()/flush_buffers() on both backends safely
6. Store is NOT graph truth owner — explicit diagnostic helpers reflect reality
