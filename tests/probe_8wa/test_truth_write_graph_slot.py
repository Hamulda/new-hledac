"""
Sprint 8WA: Truth-Write Graph Attachment Role Split — probe tests

Tests lock the following invariants:
1. _truth_write_graph is independent of _ioc_graph (analytics/donor) and _stix_graph (STIX)
2. inject_truth_write_graph() sets _truth_write_graph, clears _graph_attachment_kind
3. truth_write_graph_supports_buffered_writes() is dedicated to truth-write slot
4. _graph_ingest_findings uses _truth_write_graph, not _ioc_graph
5. aclose() flushes/closes _truth_write_graph separately from _ioc_graph
6. get_truth_write_graph() returns the injected truth-write graph
7. DuckPGQGraph must NEVER be injected into _truth_write_graph slot
8. No new graph framework — three separate slots remain explicit
